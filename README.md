To run the server:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm install run-sequence`
3. `gulp clean`
4. `gulp`

Mango will be located at http://localhost:8888.

To run production server, run `gulp build` instead of `gulp`. Production server at http://localhost:9999

Note: you need to run `gulp clean` everytime you restart the server. We'll fix this in the future.
